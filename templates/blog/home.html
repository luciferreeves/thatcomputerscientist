      This website is a work in progress. I am currently working on adding more
      features to this website. I aim to build a retro looking personal website,
      where I will share my articles and Ideas, which will be built entirely
      around the idea of "collaborative writing" â€” where anyone can write new
      articles or edit existing ones.
