# Welcome to the contributing guide

I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

GitHub is being exclusively used to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests for this project. Following is a guideline for developing via GitHub:

## Pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (see [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed anything, update the documentation as well as list them in your pull request.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Bugs and Features
I will use GitHub issues to track bugs and features. If you want to request a feature or report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/luciferreeves/thatcomputerscientist/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

**PS:** Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Coding Style
Use a Consistent Coding Style. I'm borrowing these from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 80 character line length
* try linting for style unification
