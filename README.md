# Shifoo (Previously _That Computer Scientist_)
Source Code for my Personal Website.

- Visit [shi.foo](https://shi.foo) to take a look at the current build.

- ~~Visit [preview.thatcomputerscientist.com](https://preview.thatcomputerscientist.com) to see a instant live deployment of changes whenever I start changing something on my local machine. (_Availability of this server is not guaranteed as it is only active whenever I am working on the project_. Also, sometimes I keep the project loaded in my code editor, while being idle or doing something else â€“ the link is viewable during this time as well.)~~

- `preview.thatcomputerscientist.com` is no longer available. The shell script [`runserver.sh`](runserver.sh) can be used to start a local server that presents two domain options:
    - `[*].peek.shi.foo` 
    - `[*].peek.thatcomputerscientist.com`

Both these domains point to `127.0.0.1` and its a matter of preference which one to choose. The script also automatically generates SSL certificates for both domains and starts the server with HTTPS enabled. A complete, example command chain now looks like:
